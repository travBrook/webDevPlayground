****
For example, in chromatic order, [OIII] maps to blue, H-alpha maps to green,
[SII] maps to red, and the narrowband continuum maps to red. 
Alternatively, you could try [OIII]as blue, [SII] as green, and H-alpha as red.
Experiment with color choices to highlight different features in the field.

Notes on images:

HorseHead (Natural) :
Had to make violet very dark so it was not overpowering/reduce cloudiness
Filters matched with colors

HorseHead (False):
Filters & Colors:
HAlpha : Blue
O      : Green
S      : Red/Orange
nr     : Red

I chose this sceheme because HAplha and S were the most prominent in the 
picture -- and in he same areas of the image, and I wanted them to be ... prettier colors 
The green of the O in that pocket is awesome because it is the only color there -- Nice splash

Helix (Natural):
Matched colors and filters

Helix (False):
Ha	: Green	
O	: Red
S	: Blue

Got rid of nr because there was a lot of noise in the image
Goal: to bring out the O filter -- so I used red surrounded by blue and green
Which to make blue, which to make green? It looked best with as reading from
left to right -- the colors in which the order they appear are chromatic.
Blue gives a space feeling -- which was most of the background. The green and 
red blended to make a beautiful yellow

Thors (Natural):
Blah

Thors (False):
nr	: Red
Ha	: Red/orange
S	: Green
O	: Blue

I could see that the Ha and O filters were lined up, and I imagined a nice purple when mixing them
The results show I was right -- and the S filter gives a cool shadow to it


Western Veil (Natural):
Blah

Western Veil (False):
nr	: Red
Ha	: Red orange
S	: Green
O	: Blue

M15 Star Cluster (Natural):
Had to adjust gamma for the green filter

M15 Star Cluster (False):
NA --no filter options for star clusters

NGC 6946 (Natural):
Blah

NGC6946 (False):
Not the best so far 
nr	: Red
S	: Orange/Red
O	: Green
Ha	: Blue
